# Temperature Conversion Calculator

Welcome to the Temperature Conversion Calculator! This simple Python script converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Features

- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: \( F = C \times 1.8 + 32 \)
- Takes user input for the temperature in Celsius
- Displays the converted temperature in Fahrenheit

## Usage

1. **Input**: Enter a temperature in degrees Celsius when prompted.
2. **Output**: The script will calculate and display the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```bash
   python temperature_conversion.py
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to use the calculator.

## Example

```bash
Hello there, what is your name? Alice
Nice to meet you Alice, I hope you are doing well. Welcome to our temperature conversion calculator

Please enter a value in degrees Celsius: 25

25.0 degrees Celsius is 77.0 degrees Fahrenheit. We hope that was helpful!
